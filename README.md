### Food Recognition from Image

Using a photo taken before and after a meal, the food on a plate is automatically detected via image segmentation, and the percentage of food eaten is calculated.

### Gamification

Users are rewarded points when they save food or record purchased food. These points can be used to revive the player's island, providing a visual representation of their progress.
